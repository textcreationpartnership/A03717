         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But God willeth nothing beſides himſelfe, and his owne goodneſſe, and glorie neceſſarily, in all things elſe, without himſelfe, he is an agent altogether volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie.

This beſide we may conceiue to be done, according to the priuat capacity of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4444:7"/>for the publike good of his Church: by the capacitie of the receiuer, I meane, no ſtrength of free-will, or naturall preparation, (as if grace were ſo beholding to nature, as ſome Philoſophers teach, the ſoule is to the good diſpoſition of the body in her firſt <hi>determinate being</hi> in the body) but I meane Gods owne worke, as well ſeene in the opening, as in the filling of his ſeruants ſoules: for hee that gaue <hi>Salomon</hi> wiſedome,<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 4.</note> gaue him likewiſe <hi>a large heart</hi> to receiue it; and he enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth mens hearts, as he purpoſeth to imploy them, <hi>ſecundum quod expedit,</hi> as farre forth as is expedient, as <hi>Ierome</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4. And, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith of prophecy, <hi>quantum cauſa erigit propter quam da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, Rom.</hi> 12. as much as the cauſe requireth for which it is giuen. The end is the publike good of the Church, which is either the good of order, or the good of ornament, or the good of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In eminent gifts, there is diuerſitie for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in diuers gifts, there is preeminence for the order of the Church: both diuerſitie and preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence for the maintenance of charitie, as is plaine in the Apoſtles illuſtration from diuers members of the body, (a common, but as euen <hi>Menenius Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> in <hi>Liuie,</hi> may teach vs a moſt feeling ſimilitude:) for one member would not loue another, if one did not helpe another; one ſhould not helpe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if one did not need another; one ſhould not need another if one had not ſomewhat aboue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: wherefore God hath diuided his bleſſings in that manner you haue heard, that thoſe termes of

Therefore, as in part hath beene ſhewed you, the manifold Wiſedome of God hath manifeſted it ſelfe, by giuing diuers gifts to his Church; as <hi>Dauid</hi> dedicated to the Temple, veſſels of gold, veſſels of ſiluer, and veſſels of braſſe, and, as it was the cuſtome of the Roman chiefe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, when they triumphed, and did aſcend the Capitoll,

Now let mee perſwade ſuch in this aſſembly, as thinke they haue receiued little in humility and contentation, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their wills vnto his will, which hath alotted them, at leaſt, as themſelues imagine, but a ſmall proportion.

Neuer let vs flatter, and ſooth our ſelues, becauſe this was a plant which God neuer planted; his iudgements know well enough, how to begin in his owne houſe, with his owne children, at his owne Sanctuary.

Much reading, without reference vnto action, is like much eating: a ſpirituall kind of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſme, and knowledge for priuate ſatisfaction (as one well ſaith) is but a Curtezan, more for pleaſure then for propagation. God giueth none learning, as a man giueth a booke to a Library, there to bee ſtalled and chained, which ſometimes requireth more skill to pick, and extract learning out of it, then the booke hath learning in it: <hi>Aliquidinterſit inter te &amp; librum:</hi> Let there be ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and a booke: Tis <hi>Seneca</hi> his counſell.

To the contrary minds of contrary men, in our contrary times, wherein we ſee many, that in all likelihood, would bee moſt backward for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, moſt forward for preferment, what ſhould a man ſay? Surely might true ſeriouſnes begge for me, that the ſuite might not ſeeme ridiculous, I would beſeech my Mother (I meane this famous Vniuerſitie) to keepe backe ſome of their clothes, from ſome of them. But let them goe, I haue done: me thinks, when wee ponder, and ballance this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we haue little reaſon to enuy them: for our

                  <p>To paſſe by the Prophet, who threatneth inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, all Gods threatnings, who threatneth principally, may be thought, either abſolute or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall: of the latter, the condition is ſometimes concealed within the purpoſe of his owne will, Sometimes expreſſed, and that extraordinarily by ſingular reuelation vnto ſome, or vnto all in his written word ordinatily: the reuealed ordinarie condition is either Legal, <hi>If you will not obey, Leu.</hi> 26. or Euangelicall, <hi>Except you repent, Luk.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.5. Repentance is an ordinary reuealed Euangelicall condition to bee ſtill ſupplied, whenſoeuer God threatneth, and giueth ſpace for repentance.

There were more daies, you know, ſpent in the deſtruction of one City <hi>Ierico,</hi> then in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the whole world: the whole world was made in ſixe, yet notwithſtanding the wickedneſſe of many generations, whereunto wee haue added no ſmall portion, it ſtands after many thouſands.

If wee repent when wee cannot ſinne, gramercy ſinnes, they leaue vs, this commeth from feare, all is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, no thanke to vs, wee leaue not them, nothing here is voluntary. And what equity doe we call it, to lay the heauieſt burthen, on the weakeſt beaſt, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4444:26"/>force old age, ſo feeble, that it cannot beare it ſelfe, to beare the burthen of our repentance? forſooth, when our enemy, the ſtrong man, is growne ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by preſcription; when our rotten tabernacle is ready to fall about our eares; when cuſtome hath turned infirmities into nature; when ſin is ſoked into ſubſtance, and our bones are full of the vices of our youth, then belike we would repent, we would if we could: but be ſure, that as he who neuer went to Schoole, will hardly reade his neck-verſe; ſo hee that neuer learned what repentance was in his life, ſhall in his death find it exceeding hard, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. To conclude, ſince heauen, as ſome ſay, is like <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> his Court, no mourners enter thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all there haue wedding garments, ſince it is mourne in earth, or mourne in hell; woe vnto vs, if wee defer our repentance; woe vnto vs, if we repent not our deferring; woe vnto vs, if wee repent not as ſoone as we can, &amp; repent for this, that we repented no ſooner: <hi>Foelices quibus hae minae fient medicinae;</hi> Happy, thriſe happy are they, whom theſe <hi>woes</hi> ſhal woo to repentance.

                  <p>That the nature of all vertues, conſiſted in a point indiuiſible, and all ſwaruings or declinations from that point, offences, were equall, was out of the more iudicious Philoſophers Schooles, once reiected as a Paradoxe, and can now by no meanes be receiued, as an Orthodoxe concluſion in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.

This might ſerue for eſtabliſhment of that foundation vpon which I purpoſe with helpe of your attention, to raiſe a greater building, among ſober judgements; and for the reſt, where it ſerues not, be it here pronounced, that the grand Muſter-maſter of Rome, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who preſſeth many weake reaſons, and vnwilling authorities to follow his campe and cauſe, with bagge and baggage, hath not onely ſatisfied, but gratified the moſt curious inquiſition, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in this argument: I meane, in his firſt booke <hi>De amiſſa gratta,</hi> and ninth Chapter, where, though he come wretchedly ſhort of his owne proiect, to proue that ſome ſinnes are in themſelues veniall, others mortall; yet hee ſpeakes home to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that there are moates and beames, Gnats and Camels; all ſinnes are not equall.

Now their ſpeciall kind or nature, ſinnes doe deriue, ſome ſay, from the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4444:72"/>ſcope or intent of a ſinners will; others from their obiects; others from the ſinnes inconformitie or repugnancie to the Law. Betweene theſe aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I doe conceiue little or no maner oppoſition: For they who draw the ſpeciall nature of ſinnes from their obiects, vnderſtand not obiects in any materiall ſenſe and conſideration (as if ſuch a reall impreſſion vpon ſuch or ſuch an obiect, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently concluſiue of ſuch or ſuch a ſinne.) So, that French Knight <hi>Tirell,</hi> the glaunce of whoſe arrow diſpatcht King <hi>Ruſus,</hi> ſhould haue beene as much a Regicide as <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Better I cannot ſuddenly deliuer this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for all capacities, then if I plainely ſay, ſinnes receiue their nature from their aime; from their aime therefore they receiue their degrees of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie. For example, whenſocuer the will from within giues the King of Armascharge,<note place="margin">

Therefore that ſinne aſcends to the higheſt pitch, which aimes at God,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4444:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>the higheſt Maieſtie. All ſinnes, I graunt, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, as he is the chiefeſt good from whom all ſinners make an Apoſtacie, <hi>They haue forſaken me the fountaine of liuing waters,</hi> and as he is that ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Law-giuer, whoſe will all ſinners doe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe. All ſinnes aime not at God, as at their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate obiect, but onely the breaches of the firſt Table; therefore are they more heinous, then the breaches of the ſecond. The reaſon; becauſe the more principall obligation inferres alwaies a more principall guilt in the forfaiture. If you bee bound in a Recogniſance to the King, tis more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly extended, then if you bee bound to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon. Now the bond of obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, you yeeld, to be more principall: <hi>Wee ought to obey God, rather then men, Acts</hi> 5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt graunt, that the diſobedience to God is more principall, then if one man ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another. The common obiection againſt this laſt poſition, you haue often heard, that God in the ſixth of <hi>Hoſeah,</hi> and Chriſt in the ninth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> preferre mercie, a duetie of the ſecond Table, before ſacrifice, a duetie of the firſt: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution you may heare as often, that any morall duetie, though of the ſecond Table, may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge place of right, right before any ceremoniall, though of the firſt Table. For the Scribes confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the twelfth of <hi>Marke,</hi> that to <hi>Loue God, and our neighbour as our ſelues, is more then all whole burnt offerings and ſacrifices,</hi> holds not onely <hi>in ſenſu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito,</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:4444:73"/>but alſo <hi>in ſenſu diuiſo.</hi> Euery branch of this loue is more then all whole burnt offerings and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: <hi>To doe Iuſtice and Iudgement, is more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Lord, then ſacrifice, Prou.</hi> 21. Thus farre we proceede clearely, without any rubbe at all, In theſe, there may be more ſcruple about this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, our example in hand; How were the ſinnes of <hi>Elies</hi> ſonnes againſt the Lord?</p>
                  <p>Their ſinnes were two. Firſt, That they preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the time, and were their owne caruers, in ſnat ching perforce more of the ſacrifice, then God had alotted to the Prieſt as his portion, <hi>Leuit</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They lay with the women that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at the doore of the Tabernacle, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. A ſinne, not much vnlike that, for which <hi>Nectarius</hi> once pulled downe publike confeſſion in the Church of Conſtantinople, and for which, I hope, wee ſhall neuer ſet vp Popiſh ſhrift againe in the Church of England. Let vs apply the ſame fact for ſubſtance, and ordinarie deformitie, vnto other men elſewhere. For as much as they treſpaſſe not vpon the firſt, but vpon the ſecond Table, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in the ſence receiued, ſtile them ſinnes againſt the Lord: yet heare firſt what the Lord himſelfe ſayth, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 10. <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me.</hi> Then denie, if you can, that a place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, the Tabernacle, and perſons conſecrated, Prieſts, aduance theft aboue theft, to ſacriledge, and inhaunce adulterie aboue adulterie, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane pollution: The ſcandall (I am ſure) iſſuing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4444:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>out of theſe circumſtances, which directly thwart his ordinance, corrupting and vnhallowing conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, redounds by conſequence and reſultance to the Lord himſelfe. Right ſo it was in thoſe dayes, and wilbe while prouidence continues or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of men in the World, as the good Biſhop ſpeakes in the fourth of that golden Treatiſe, <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minoſior culpaeſt, vbi honeſtior ſtatus:</hi> The more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the condition, the more reprochfull the tranſgreſſion.

                  <p>Thus, briefly to ſum vp things, you haue heard for the generall, that offences being vnequall, take their degrees of inequality thence, whence they take their ſpeciall kinde and nature, from their obiects, not in a materiall, but a formall conſideration: more plainly, from their ayme: the higher they ayme, the higher the offence. Therefore offences againſt God and the firſt, more haynous then offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt man and the ſecond Table.</p>
                  <p>For the ſpeciall you haue heard, that <hi>Ophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> offences, though they were for the naked fact againſt the ſecond, were for circumſtances of place and perſons, againſt the firſt Table, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord.</p>

Thus, as in a throng, it comes to paſſe, that a man of loweſt ſtature, who kept leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, is lifted vp aboue the ſhoulders of the taller, &amp; made a laughing ſtocke: So in the courſe of this world, where ſinnes of all ſorts are pell mell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, the leaſt are many times expoſed to moſt ſhame, and cenſure.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4444:78"/>proceeds out of his owne mouth: <hi>The Iudge ſhall iudge it.</hi> He was Iudge himſelf; he did not iudge it. Yet I would not be conceiued in a wider ſenſe, then I dare ſpeake. You ſhall baniſh ſome iuſtice, if you baniſh all fauour out of iudgement. The Imperiall Lawes, though they deteſt reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet, I am ſure, fauour the Defendant more then the Plaintiffe; and by the municipall Lawes of this Land (as I haue heard) a Barre to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intent is good, whereas a Declaration muſt containe preciſe forme and certaintie. The reaſon I take to bee that of the Ciuilian, <hi>Actor Inſtructus accedat oportet:</hi> and the reaſon of that reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe actions are according to nature, more in our power then paſſions. To bee ſhort, fauours within the cauſe, not fauours without the cauſe; legall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, not perſonall, are in iudgement conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A Iudge, after the manner you haue heard qualified, ſtands bound in reaſon to execute the proper act of his function; for <hi>the iudgement</hi> (as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat</hi> ſpake) <hi>is the Lords,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. Therefore are Iudges a liuing kind of inſtruments. You know, the nature of inſtruments conſiſts in vſe and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereſoeuer you finde inſtruments without operation, as in the <hi>Pſalme, They haue eyes and ſee not,</hi> you finde Idols. The ſpeech then is as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and agreeable, when wee ſay, <hi>The Iudge ſhall iudge it,</hi> as when we ſay, <hi>The eye ſhall ſee, the eare ſhall heare;</hi> they be the Miniſters of God, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4444:78"/>were Iudges, (ſuch dayes there were, howſoeuer the French aduocate diſpute againſt it, as vnbefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Maieſtie) in thoſe dayes a widdow comming as <hi>Xiphilinus</hi> and <hi>Spartianus</hi> ſay, to <hi>Adrian,</hi> but, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates, to <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> to ſeeke for iuſtice, and being anſwered, hee was not at leiſure, replied, <hi>Noliigitur regnare:</hi> Be not at leiſure to bee King. The euent bids me beleeue it of <hi>Philip;</hi> for I finde, that his neglect of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſuite, when he came to be righted againſt <hi>Attalus,</hi> was the cauſe why <hi>Pauſanias</hi> killed him.

Beleeue him not, ſpare him not, fauour him not, ſhriue him to the proof; arraign him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him, puniſh him; puniſh him in the body, by faſting &amp; mortification; puniſh him in the ſoule, by repentance and contrition; puniſh him in the purſe, by works of charity and reſtitution.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4444:92"/>Certainely this <hi>flying Booke</hi> mightily triumphed there, like the Angell of the Lord in the Campe of <hi>Aſhur,</hi> that all after-ages might out of an awfull reuerence, frame this incontroulable inference, that he which plagued a Kingdome, wil neuer leaue an houſe vnplagued for periury.

                  <p>Firſt, that ſafe-conduct was granted not by the Councell, but by <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> by which diſtinction (vpon ſuppoſall that <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> and the Councell might be diſtinguiſhed) the fault is not diſcharged, but only tranſlated.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it was againſt vnlawful violence, and not againſt lawfull executions; where he ſtands beholding to <hi>Minſinger</hi> the Ciuilian, who maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines indeed, that a man may bee puniſhed for ſome ſuperuenient miſbehauiour, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſafe-conduct; whereas <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for non-appearance, ſuffered in that very caſe, for which hee receiued warrant of ſecurity. The diſputers third euaſion may wreſt laughter from the ſpleene of grauitie it ſelfe, which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4444:93"/>is, that hee had ſafe conduct to come, but not to returne.

For <hi>Moſes, Samuel, Eſdras</hi> with the reſt, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4444:105"/>ſame men who for their own times were Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spokeſ-men, approued themſelues likewiſe for the perpetuall benefit of aftertimes, his full Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.

That I may not ſingle out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets one after another, but ground the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof vpon ſome conſent; I take that modeſt collection in <hi>Caluins</hi> Preface vpon <hi>Eſay,</hi> to be very probable, that it was their familiar vſage (as hee there, and others elſewhere from <hi>Abac.</hi> 2. and <hi>Eſay,</hi> 8. coniecture to faſten the ſumme and abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their errands to the dores of the Temple, which, after ſome few dayes view, was taken downe, laid vp and kept in the treaſurie for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred monument. Heere might I ſtand vpon the brinke of this former couenant, would I but liſten with affection to ſome mens gloſſes vpon Gods promiſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,</hi> vſed indeed for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of pentifull grace vnder the Goſpell, which the Spirit maketh the <hi>adminiſtration of righteouſnes,</hi> giuing with the precept power of performance, farre aboue the letter of the Law, the <hi>miniſtration of condemnation;</hi> but they abuſe it, as contayning an extreme difference, in reſpect of writing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them both, or rather (if it be any ground of their argument) a plaine oppoſition. From the ſtrict ſeuerity whereof it would follow, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould bee inuiſibly written in the old, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4444:105"/>viſibly written in the new Teſtament; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrariwiſe, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is a witneſſe aboue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that the very <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>had the Law of God written in their hearts.</hi> And this bleſſed draught of truth written in inke and paper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out (except all Chriſtian experience be but a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) hath been and ſtill is not an enemy to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſecret printing; but a ſubordinate meanes to ingraue the ſame Characters more deepely in the mind and conſcience. For which cauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. writeth outwardly of this inward kinde of writing, wherefore I truſt, we may fairely proceede ouer hence to the new Teſtament, as from ſtrength to ſtrength, notwithſtanding this barreleſſe barre of ſeeming ſeparation betwixt them. The writers accounted the firſt on this ſide, are the Apoſtles, who in the moſt ancient Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, and therefore not vpon the motion of any priuate braine, ſent letters vnto Antioch by <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who went with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and therfore not for want of truſty meſſengers; wherin this was part of their ſtile,<note place="margin">

When I found in ſome Antiquaries, that the Reede hath been vſed for a pen, and that the Canes which grew in the banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred matter for paper, I remembred thoſe <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> frogs in <hi>Aelian,</hi> who taking in their mouthes, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſaue themſelues, from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by the water Serpent, the rather becauſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4444:106"/>me thought it might be a fit embleme, to ſhew that the weakeſt conceits, taking hold of writing, cannot bee conſumed by reuolution of yeares whoſe Hyeroglyphicke was a ſerpent. And as the tyrannie of time, which like <hi>Saturne</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure his owne children, is by this art greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled: ſo Heretikes alſo, who winde themſelues into the Church, as marginall notes oft creepe into the text, are refuted and reiected by recourſe vnto this originall. You may be told of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and as thoſe Pagan<note n="*" place="margin">Druides.</note> Prieſts of France, that in their rules abhorred writing. But where are their precepts? how many footſteps are there now remaining of their learning? their very names in theſe dayes had beene vnknowne but for writing, and happily their owne opinions been vnwritten; but that they were in their owne times accounted Paradoxes. But was not this the diſcipline of Gods owne houſe, for two thouſand yeares and vpwards, to feed his eldeſt children onely with tradition? Surely the diuers reſtitutions and reformations of Gods true worſhip, argue that thoſe times were not generally ſo fortunate for Religion. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that in one or two families, when men were at the feweſt, their hearts at the pureſt, and their liues at the longeſt, Religion were a while retained, yet was it not onely by tradition, but by Viſions, Oracles, Elements, and Rudiments, which might be vnto them in ſtead of writing. Writing began with <hi>Moſes</hi> very conueniently, when the number of men was much increaſed, and their yeeres much
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4444:107"/>ſhortned, that ſo Gods worſhip might bee propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, both downwards to ſucceeding generations. <hi>This ſhall bee written for the generation to come, and the people which ſhall bee created, ſhall praiſe the Lord, Pſalm.</hi> 102. And abroad to diuers Nations before Chriſt, in ſome diuine glimſes obſcurely ſhining through the chinkes and crannies of the then-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying partition wall, as appeareth in the Eunuch: after Chriſt in a brighter and more cleare light, at the noonetide of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Goe therefore and teach all nations</hi>] And who will preſume to except this manner of teaching? By which that it was their purpoſe to teach, I could gather further out of their owne ſeuerall writings; and if it needed, I could adde both the ſuffrages of primitiue Fathers and Hiſtories; but they being Gods witneſſes and Ambaſſadors, haue as you ſee written, and therefore may not bee thought (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept wee ſaw greater contrarie proofes) to haue done what they did, beſides their Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>All which conſidered, the leſſe maruaile may it be, that we deale in ſtrict termes with our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, holding ſtifly <hi>Tertullians</hi> plea againſt <hi>Hermoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Scriptum doceat Hermogenis officina;</hi> for whence the needleſſe ouerplus of their vnwritten ſupplies proceed, we know not: from themſelues in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-hood that are parties, who muſt not think to be conueied into the roome of Iudges by this couze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; but theſe written euidences (wee are ſure) are Gods owne deedes and ſpecialties, wherein moreouer wee are taught, that the Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4444:107"/>them, and they ſhall be found liars, <hi>The Lord will adde vnto them the plagues of this Booke,</hi> and they ſhall be curſed and abominable that ſhall offer to peece his word, to mend his workeman-ſhip, to mingle and imbaſe his precious gold of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the droſſe and vnſanctified refuſe of their owne inuentions. Let it then bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged among vs (for Papiſts I hope are abſent) a ſilly ſhift of Romiſh brokery, for vent of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition any way to diſcredit the Scripture; yea let it be grauen with an iron pen in lead or in ſtone for euer; that they, who would ſometimes haue ſet vp thoſe vnwritten verities, fell in the end to open rayling at the Scripture; that all after-ages may bee filled with queſtions and exclamations. What? were all colours ſpent? was there no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill left? did the luxuriant wits of Rome end in ſuch barrenneſſe and beggerie, that nothing could bee forged, but a <hi>mute,</hi> or a <hi>brute, a dumbe</hi> or dead letter, a <hi>blacke Goſpell,</hi> or a peece of <hi>inky-diuinity? O thou that deſtroyeſt the wiſedome of the wiſe, and caſteſt away the vnderſtanding of the prudent,</hi> how haſt thou confounded the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this world, that they ſhould thus turne the edge of their malice from our cauſe to thine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and at the loweſt ebbe, in the ruines of their ſtrength, bid battell vnto the Lord of Hoſtes, their ſtrongeſt and their mightieſt enemy? They might haue knowne, that whatſoeuer may cauſe their <hi>ioy to bee full,</hi> whatſoeuer may <hi>perfect them
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4444:108"/>for euery good worke,</hi> whatſoeuer may <hi>make them wiſe vnto ſaluation,</hi> all this is written, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man of God ſhould not preſume, or bee wiſe aboue that which is written, certainely a man of reaſon ſhould not preſume, or be wiſe againſt that which is written.
